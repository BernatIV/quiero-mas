# My Portfolio
My portfolio is a mobile app called 'Quiero MÃ¡s' which is currently being developed for a real client. 
This app aims to increase customers loyalty of a cute bar located in the center of Barcelona. 

## Build With
I have developed this app in three distincted parts. 

* **Java with Spring Boot** to build a restful API, creates the database and does logic stuff. 
* **Amazon Web Services** to store and run my server program and the database, which run separately but are connected all the time. 
* **React Native**. The app we install in our phones. It is aimed for Android and IOS phones.
